### 2024-10-04: Task 60 - Conducting Security Audits

On Day 60, I focused on conducting security audits to ensure that the application was secure from potential vulnerabilities. I started by reviewing the codebase and identifying areas where security best practices had not been followed, such as improper validation of user inputs and lack of proper encryption for sensitive data. I also used security tools to scan for common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

After identifying the issues, I implemented security patches, including input validation, securing API endpoints, and applying encryption to sensitive data like passwords and payment information. Additionally, I tested the application against potential security threats and ensured that all known vulnerabilities were addressed. By the end of the day, the application was much more secure, with various enhancements implemented to protect against cyber threats.
