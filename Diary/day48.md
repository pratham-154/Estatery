### 2024-09-17: Task 48 - Resolving Bugs and Errors

On Day 48, I focused on resolving various bugs and errors that had been identified during testing and development. The day began with reviewing the issues reported by the testing team and analyzing the root causes. I worked on debugging the frontend and backend, using tools like Chrome Developer Tools and server logs to pinpoint the issues. Some of the bugs were related to incorrect data display, broken links, and minor user interface glitches, while others were server-side issues, such as incorrect API responses.

I also prioritized critical errors that were affecting the application's functionality, ensuring that users had a seamless experience. After resolving the bugs, I conducted retests to ensure that the fixes were successful and didnâ€™t introduce new issues. By the end of the day, most of the reported issues had been resolved, and the application was running more smoothly.
