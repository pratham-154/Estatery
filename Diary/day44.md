### 2024-09-11: Task 44 - Implementing AI-Powered Recommendations

On Day 44, I worked on implementing AI-powered product recommendations on the site. This feature provided personalized suggestions to users based on their browsing history, past purchases, and similar users' preferences. I began by integrating machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate relevant product recommendations.

The system used collaborative filtering techniques to predict which products a user might be interested in. I also implemented a recommendation engine that suggested products based on the user's browsing activity, such as showing related items on the product detail page. By the end of the day, the AI-powered recommendation system was functioning, providing personalized shopping experiences for users.
