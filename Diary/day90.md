### 2024-11-18: Task 90 - Setting Up Customer Support

On Day 90, I focused on setting up customer support for both the app and website. With the launch and growing user base, it was crucial to have a dedicated team and system in place to address user inquiries and issues. I worked with the customer support team to define workflows, set up help desk software, and create an extensive knowledge base for common user questions.

We also implemented a ticketing system to manage and prioritize support requests, ensuring users received timely responses. By the end of the day, the customer support system was fully operational, ready to assist users with any issues they might encounter.
