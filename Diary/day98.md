### 2024-11-28: Task 98 - Conducting Final Meeting

On Day 98, I led the final meeting for the project, where I brought together all key stakeholders, team members, and contributors. The primary goal of this meeting was to review the project’s achievements, discuss the challenges faced during development, and acknowledge the hard work of everyone involved. 

The session provided an opportunity for everyone to reflect on the process, ask any remaining questions, and provide feedback on how the project was managed. By the end of the day, all parties had a clear understanding of the project’s overall success and the next steps moving forward.
