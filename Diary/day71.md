### 2024-10-21: Task 71 - Testing Mobile App Functionality

On Day 71, I focused on testing the functionality of the mobile app. Testing was critical to ensure that all the features worked as expected and provided a seamless user experience. I began by manually testing core features such as login, registration, browsing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out. I also tested the app’s responsiveness, checking how it performed on different screen sizes and devices.

In addition to manual testing, I wrote unit tests to automate the verification of individual components and functions. This helped identify any bugs early on in the development process and ensured that changes didn’t break existing features. By the end of the day, I had conducted thorough testing of the mobile app’s core functionalities, ensuring that the app was stable and ready for further refinement.
