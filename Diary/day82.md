### 2024-11-06: Task 82 - Enhancing Accessibility Features

On Day 82, I focused on enhancing the accessibility features of the app and website. Making both platforms accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, was a priority. I reviewed the design and code to ensure compliance with accessibility standards, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). 

I implemented features like screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and color contrast adjustments to make the app and website more inclusive. We also conducted usability testing with individuals who have accessibility needs to ensure that the new features were effective. By the end of the day, the platforms had been significantly improved in terms of accessibility, ensuring a better experience for all users.
