### 2024-12-09: Task 105 - Preparing Post-Launch Strategy

On Day 105, I focused on preparing the post-launch strategy for the project. This involved creating a plan for continued user engagement, bug fixes, and performance monitoring after the launch. I collaborated with the marketing, support, and development teams to define key metrics and goals for the post-launch phase.

By the end of the day, we had a clear roadmap for post-launch activities, including strategies for promoting the project, addressing user concerns, and optimizing the product based on real-world feedback.
