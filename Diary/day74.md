### 2024-10-24: Task 74 - Preparing for Mobile App Launch

On Day 74, I worked on preparing for the mobile app’s launch. This involved a few key steps, such as finalizing the app’s store listings on Google Play and the Apple App Store, preparing launch assets, and ensuring that the app met all the guidelines for both platforms. I also worked on optimizing the app’s performance for the final time, ensuring that it was responsive and stable under real-world usage conditions.

I collaborated with the marketing team to create promotional materials, including screenshots, videos, and app descriptions, to be used in the app store listings. Additionally, I made sure that the app’s privacy policy, terms of service, and other legal documents were in place. By the end of the day, the mobile app was ready for submission to the app stores, and we were just a few steps away from the official launch.
