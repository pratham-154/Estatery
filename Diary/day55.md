### 2024-09-26: Task 55 - Testing Deployment

On Day 55, I conducted thorough testing on both the backend and frontend after deployment to ensure everything was functioning as expected in the production environment. I verified that all features, such as user authentication, product listings, and the checkout process, were working seamlessly. I also conducted load testing to ensure that the application could handle the expected traffic.

During testing, I identified a few minor issues, such as broken links and incorrect data loading, which were promptly fixed. I also monitored server performance and ensured that all APIs were responding quickly without any delays. By the end of the day, the deployment was thoroughly tested and confirmed to be functioning smoothly in the production environment.
