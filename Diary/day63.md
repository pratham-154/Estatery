### 2024-10-09: Task 63 - Monitoring Post-Launch Performance

On Day 63, I focused on monitoring the post-launch performance of the website. After the launch, it was important to keep track of user activity, server performance, and any issues that might arise. I used analytics tools to monitor user behavior, including how users were navigating the site, which features were most popular, and where users were encountering problems.

I also kept an eye on the serverâ€™s performance, ensuring that the website was loading quickly and that the backend was handling the traffic efficiently. During this period, I addressed any issues that came up, such as slow page load times or broken links. By the end of the day, the website was performing well, and the data gathered would help guide any necessary improvements or optimizations.
