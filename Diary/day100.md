### 2024-12-02: Task 100 - Transitioning to Future Enhancements

On Day 100, I worked on transitioning the project to future enhancements. This involved preparing the project for long-term growth by setting up a plan for ongoing updates, feature additions, and scaling efforts. I collaborated with the development team to outline a roadmap for the next phase of the project.

The goal was to ensure that the product remained competitive and adaptable to the evolving needs of users. By the end of the day, we had established a clear plan for future enhancements, with timelines and priorities clearly defined.
