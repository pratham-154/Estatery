### 2024-08-23: Task 31 - Integrating Sass for Styling

On Day 31, I integrated Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) into the project to enhance the styling of the application. Sass allows for more maintainable and reusable CSS code, thanks to its features like variables, mixins, and nested rules. I began by setting up the Sass compiler and refactoring the existing CSS to Sass, which made the styles more modular and easier to maintain. I created variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure consistency throughout the site.

In addition to basic styles, I created mixins and reusable styles for common components such as buttons, cards, and form elements. This not only made the CSS more organized but also reduced redundancy across the codebase. By the end of the day, the styling of the application was improved, with a more scalable and maintainable structure in place using Sass.
