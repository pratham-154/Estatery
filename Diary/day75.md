### 2024-10-25: Task 75 - Launching the Mobile App

On Day 75, we officially launched the mobile app. I submitted the app to both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, ensuring that all necessary information and assets were included. I also coordinated with the marketing team to ensure that the launch was well-publicized, sharing the news through social media channels, email newsletters, and other promotional outlets.

During the launch, I monitored the appâ€™s performance, checking for any issues such as crashes or errors. I was also on standby to address any urgent bugs that users reported. By the end of the day, the mobile app was live and available for download, and we began tracking the user feedback to gauge its success.
