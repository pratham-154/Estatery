### 2024-10-30: Task 78 - Planning for Future Enhancements

On Day 78, I worked on planning future enhancements for both the mobile app and the website. This involved reviewing the feedback collected from users, stakeholders, and internal teams to identify areas that needed improvement or new features that could be added. I collaborated with the product and development teams to prioritize these enhancements based on user demand and feasibility. 

We brainstormed ideas for improving user engagement, optimizing performance, and adding new functionalities that would enhance the overall user experience. The goal was to create a roadmap for the next phase of development, ensuring that the app and website continue to evolve in a way that meets user needs and aligns with business objectives. By the end of the day, we had a clear plan for the upcoming enhancements and a timeline for implementation.
