### 2024-09-13: Task 46 - Conducting Frontend Testing

On Day 46, I conducted frontend testing to ensure the user interface was functioning as expected across different browsers and devices. I tested various components, such as the navigation bar, product listings, and checkout flow, to ensure they were responsive and displayed correctly. I also checked for any visual or functional issues that might have arisen due to the recent changes in styling or layout.

I used tools like Chrome Developer Tools to debug issues and ensure that the site was compatible with different screen sizes and browsers. I also tested the interactive elements, such as buttons and forms, to ensure that they were working smoothly. By the end of the day, the frontend had passed testing, with all major components functioning properly across all tested environments.
