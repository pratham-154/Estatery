### 2024-10-17: Task 69 - Beginning Mobile App Development

On Day 69, I began the development of the mobile app, starting with setting up the development environment and selecting the appropriate tools. We chose React Native for cross-platform development, allowing us to write one codebase for both Android and iOS. I installed the necessary dependencies, set up the folder structure, and configured the build process for both platforms. 

The initial focus was on implementing the basic app structure, including setting up navigation between different screens, creating reusable components, and establishing the core features. I collaborated with the team to ensure that the appâ€™s performance would be optimized from the beginning. By the end of the day, the app had its basic framework in place, and we had begun laying the groundwork for the remaining features.
