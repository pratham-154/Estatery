### 2025-04-18: Task 69 - Enhancing Error Handling for API Calls

* Improved the error handling mechanisms for all API requests to ensure that failures are caught and appropriately managed.

* Added user-friendly error messages for scenarios like failed network requests, invalid data, or server errors, ensuring users arenâ€™t left in the dark.

* Implemented retries for transient errors and fallback options for critical features, such as showing cached data if the live data fetch fails.

* Ensured that all API errors are logged for further debugging and monitoring.
