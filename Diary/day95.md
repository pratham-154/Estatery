### 2024-11-25: Task 95 - Archiving Project Files

On Day 95, I worked on archiving all project files for future reference. This included source code, design documents, reports, and other key materials that were created throughout the project. I ensured that everything was properly organized and stored in a secure location, making it easy to access if needed in the future.

I also ensured that all files were backed up and that any sensitive information was handled securely. By the end of the day, all project files were successfully archived and organized, ensuring that everything could be accessed for future audits, updates, or reference.
