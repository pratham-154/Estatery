### 2024-11-22: Task 94 - Documenting Lessons Learned

On Day 94, I focused on documenting the lessons learned throughout the project. This involved reflecting on the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and areas for improvement. I worked with the team to gather feedback on what went well and what could have been done differently.

We created a comprehensive document outlining the key takeaways from the project, which would serve as a valuable resource for future projects. By the end of the day, the lessons learned were documented, ensuring that the team would have insights to apply to upcoming initiatives.
