### 2024-11-11: Task 85 - Reviewing Project Success Metrics

On Day 85, I worked on reviewing the success metrics for the project. This involved analyzing data related to user engagement, traffic, sales, and customer feedback to assess how well the app and website had met our goals. I collaborated with the marketing and product teams to review KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and other metrics that would help us determine the overall success of the project. 

We also compared the performance of the app and website against industry benchmarks to ensure we were meeting or exceeding expectations. By the end of the day, we had a comprehensive overview of the projectâ€™s success, highlighting both achievements and areas that could be improved in future iterations.
