### 2024-08-27: Task 33 - Adding Product Reviews Section

On Day 33, I added a product reviews section to the individual product pages. This feature allowed users to leave feedback on products they had purchased, providing valuable insights for other customers. I began by designing a clean and user-friendly review section, including fields for users to rate the product and leave written comments. Each review included the reviewerâ€™s name, rating, and timestamp, providing context for future buyers.

I also ensured that the review section was interactive, allowing users to filter reviews by rating or sort them by date. Additionally, I implemented logic to display the average rating for each product based on the reviews submitted. By the end of the day, the product reviews feature was live, providing valuable social proof and enhancing the shopping experience.
