### 2025-03-07: Task 37 - Finalizing All Frontend Pages with Placeholder Data

* **Objective:**

    * Ensure all designed pages (Home, Property Listings, Property Details, Dashboard, User Profile, etc.) are properly structured and visually complete.

    * Use placeholder data before integrating real backend APIs.

* **Tasks Completed:**

    * Added dummy property data (title, price, location, images, descriptions).

    * Used faker.js to generate realistic placeholder content (e.g., fake property names, user profiles).

    * Ensured that all buttons, modals, and forms function correctly without backend connectivity.

* **Testing & Review:**

    * Verified all UI components are properly placed and styling is consistent across pages.

    * Ensured that dummy data loads correctly without API integration.
