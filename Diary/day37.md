### 2024-09-02: Task 37 - Setting Up Admin Panel

On Day 37, I began setting up the admin panel for the e-commerce website. This panel would allow administrators to manage users, products, orders, and reviews. I created a secure login system for the admin panel and implemented user role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel could access the panel.

The admin interface allowed for viewing and managing orders, including changing their status (e.g., "shipped" or "delivered") and handling customer inquiries. I also added features to manage products, such as adding, updating, and deleting items, as well as managing product categories and stock levels. By the end of the day, the admin panel was functional, providing a comprehensive set of tools for website administrators.
