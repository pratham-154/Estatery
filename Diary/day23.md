### 2024-08-12: Task 23 - Handling User Profile Management

On Day 23, I worked on implementing user profile management features, which allowed users to view and edit their personal information, including their name, email, and shipping address. This feature required both frontend and backend changes. I created a user profile page on the frontend where users could see their details and update them. I also added an option to change the password for security reasons.

On the backend, I updated the user authentication system to handle profile updates. This included creating API endpoints that allowed users to modify their information in the database. I implemented validation to ensure that only authorized users could make changes to their profiles. By the end of the day, the user profile management system was fully integrated, allowing users to manage their information and settings.
