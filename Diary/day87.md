### 2024-11-13: Task 87 - Preparing for Stakeholder Presentation

On Day 87, I focused on preparing for the stakeholder presentation, where I would showcase the app and website’s progress, features, and results. I created a presentation that highlighted key milestones, the technical achievements, and the impact on users and the business. I worked on refining the visual design of the slides, ensuring they were clear, professional, and easy to follow.

I also rehearsed the presentation, focusing on delivering a compelling narrative that would engage stakeholders and demonstrate the value of the project. By the end of the day, the presentation was ready, and I was prepared to present the project’s successes and future plans to the stakeholders.
