### 2024-11-26: Task 96 - Preparing Future Team Handover Notes

On Day 96, I worked on preparing handover notes for the future team. This involved compiling all relevant information about the project, including technical documentation, deployment instructions, and important contacts. The goal was to ensure that the team taking over the project would have everything they needed to continue its success.

I also created a detailed guide for ongoing maintenance and updates, outlining key processes and best practices. By the end of the day, the handover notes were complete, providing the future team with a smooth transition and ensuring that the project could continue without any disruptions.
