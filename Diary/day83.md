### 2024-11-07: Task 83 - Conducting Regular System Checks

On Day 83, I focused on conducting regular system checks to ensure the continued health and performance of the mobile app and website. These checks included verifying that all APIs were functioning correctly, monitoring server health, and performing routine security scans to identify vulnerabilities. 

I worked closely with the operations team to implement automated monitoring tools that would alert us to any issues in real time. We also set up periodic manual reviews to catch any potential issues that the automated systems might miss. By the end of the day, we had a robust system in place for ongoing maintenance and issue detection, ensuring that both platforms remain reliable.
