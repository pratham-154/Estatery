### 2024-09-03: Task 38 - Implementing Product Management in Admin Panel

On Day 38, I worked on adding product management functionality to the admin panel. This feature allowed administrators to perform operations like adding new products, editing existing product details, and deleting products from the catalog. I began by designing an intuitive interface for these actions, which included forms for entering product details such as name, description, price, and stock level. Additionally, I ensured that product categories could be managed efficiently within the panel.

I also implemented the necessary backend APIs to handle these operations. The APIs allowed admins to add, update, and delete products, with proper validation to ensure that all required fields were correctly filled out. The UI was designed to be user-friendly, with easy access to the features and clear error messages when actions could not be completed. By the end of the day, the product management feature was fully integrated, enabling the admin to control the product catalog easily.
