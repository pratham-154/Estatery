### 2024-11-20: Task 92 - Reviewing Future Scope

On Day 92, I reviewed the future scope of the project. This involved looking at long-term goals, potential features to be added, and scalability requirements as the user base grows. I collaborated with stakeholders, product managers, and the development team to discuss what features and updates would provide the most value in the coming months and years.

We also reviewed the market and industry trends to ensure that the app and website remained competitive. By the end of the day, we had a clear vision of the future direction of the project and how we could continue to innovate and meet user needs in the long run.
