### 2024-08-14: Task 25 - Implementing Wishlist Functionality

On Day 25, I implemented the wishlist functionality, allowing users to save products they were interested in purchasing later. I created a button on each product page that allowed users to add items to their wishlist. This required creating a new database collection to store the wishlist items, along with API endpoints to add, remove, and fetch wishlist items for each user.

On the frontend, I designed a wishlist page where users could view all the items they had saved. This page displayed product images, names, and prices, with options to remove items or add them to the cart. I ensured that the wishlist was persistent, so users would retain their saved items even if they logged out or returned to the site later. By the end of the day, the wishlist functionality was fully integrated and ready for use.
