### 2024-12-05: Task 103 - Conducting Final Team Debrief

On Day 103, I conducted the final team debrief, where I brought together all team members to discuss the project's outcomes. We reviewed the project's strengths, challenges, and key takeaways, and each team member shared their experiences and insights. 

This debrief was crucial for identifying any gaps in the process and understanding what worked well. It also provided an opportunity to celebrate the team's success and highlight individual contributions. By the end of the day, we had a collective understanding of the projectâ€™s journey.
