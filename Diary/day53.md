### 2024-09-24: Task 53 - Deploying Backend to Server

On Day 53, I focused on deploying the backend of the application to the server. The first step was to configure the production environment, including setting up environment variables, ensuring that the database was correctly connected, and configuring any necessary services such as Redis or caching systems. I used tools like Docker to containerize the backend, ensuring that the deployment process was smooth and consistent across different environments.

Once the environment was set up, I deployed the backend to the production server and tested the API endpoints to ensure they were working as expected. I also monitored the server logs to catch any potential errors or performance issues. By the end of the day, the backend was successfully deployed, and all functionality was tested and operational.
