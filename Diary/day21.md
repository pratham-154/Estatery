### 2024-08-08: Task 21 - Setting Up Payment Gateway Integration

On Day 21, I integrated a payment gateway into the checkout process to facilitate secure payments. I researched different payment providers and chose one that offered an easy-to-integrate API, ensuring it supported multiple payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. After setting up the account with the payment provider, I followed their documentation to implement the necessary backend API calls to process payments.

I then integrated the payment gateway on the frontend, where users could input their payment information securely. I ensured that the payment process was smooth, providing feedback to the user during each stage of the payment. After successfully completing the payment, I ensured the order was finalized and the cart was emptied. By the end of the day, the payment gateway was fully integrated, enabling secure and seamless transactions.
