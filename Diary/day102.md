### 2024-12-04: Task 102 - Setting Up Knowledge Base

On Day 102, I worked on setting up a knowledge base for the project. This included organizing all relevant documentation, such as technical specifications, troubleshooting guides, and user manuals. The knowledge base was created to be easily accessible to both the team and users, providing them with the information they needed.

I also included guidelines for future updates, ensuring that the knowledge base remained a valuable resource as the project continued to evolve. By the end of the day, the knowledge base was set up, complete with all necessary documents.
