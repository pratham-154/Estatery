### 2025-03-01: Task 32 - Adding Hover Effects for Better UI Experience

* **Purpose of Hover Effects:**

    * Improve interactivity and highlight clickable elements.

    * Provide visual feedback for actions (e.g., hovering over a button makes it slightly bigger).

* **Implementation on Various Elements:**

    * **Buttons:**

        * Change background color and add a slight scaling effect.

    * **Cards (Property Listings):**

        * Add a subtle shadow and scale effect to indicate interactivity.

    * **Navbar Links:**

        * Underline effect on hover to indicate navigation.

* **Testing Hover Effects:**

    * Ensure smooth transitions on both desktop and mobile devices (use @media queries to disable hover on touchscreens).
