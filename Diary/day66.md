### 2024-10-14: Task 66 - Adding Advanced Analytics Features

On Day 66, I worked on adding advanced analytics features to the website to gain deeper insights into user behavior. I integrated additional tracking tools to gather more granular data, such as tracking specific user actions, click events, and time spent on certain pages. This would help us better understand how users were navigating the site and where they were spending the most time.

I also worked on creating custom reports that could be easily accessed by the team, allowing them to quickly assess the performance of different aspects of the site. These reports included detailed breakdowns of user demographics, behavior patterns, and conversion funnels. By the end of the day, the website had more advanced analytics capabilities, enabling the team to make data-driven decisions.
