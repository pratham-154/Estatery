### 2024-12-11: Task 107 - Official Project Completion

On Day 107, I officially completed the project. This involved finalizing all documentation, archiving project files, and ensuring that the necessary handover processes were in place. I made sure that all tasks, whether related to development, testing, or post-launch activities, had been completed successfully.

By the end of the day, the project was officially marked as complete, and I ensured that the final deliverables were accessible to the relevant teams for future use or reference.
