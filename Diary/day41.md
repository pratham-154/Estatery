### 2025-03-12: Task 41 - Testing and Debugging Frontend Integration

* **Objective:**

    * Identify and fix bugs in frontend API integration.

    * Validate that all data updates correctly across pages.

* **Debugging Process:**

    * Checked network requests (successful API responses, error handling).

    * Fixed broken links, incorrect API calls, and missing UI elements.

* **Common Issues Resolved:**

    * Slow API responses causing UI lag → Added debouncing for search queries.

    * 404 Errors on some pages → Adjusted Next.js routing and API endpoints.

* **Final Testing Steps:**

    * Navigated through all frontend pages and ensured data loaded correctly.

    * Validated that authentication and user profile updates worked properly.

    * Fixed layout issues caused by dynamic content rendering.
