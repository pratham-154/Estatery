### 2024-09-09: Task 42 - Enhancing Security Features

On Day 42, I worked on enhancing the security features of the application. I started by reviewing the existing security protocols and identifying areas where improvements could be made. One of the first steps was to implement stronger password hashing algorithms to ensure that user passwords were stored securely. I also enabled HTTPS across the platform to ensure secure communication between the client and the server.

Additionally, I added two-factor authentication (2FA) for users, providing an extra layer of protection for accounts. I also reviewed and improved the system's access controls, ensuring that only authorized users could access sensitive data and features. By the end of the day, the security of the application was significantly improved, providing better protection against potential attacks.
