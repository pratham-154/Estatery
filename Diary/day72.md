### 2024-10-22: Task 72 - Conducting Cross-Platform Testing

On Day 72, I conducted cross-platform testing to ensure the mobile app performed well on both Android and iOS devices. Since we were using React Native, it was crucial to verify that the appâ€™s design and functionality were consistent across both platforms. I installed the app on multiple devices and checked for any platform-specific issues, such as layout inconsistencies or performance problems.

During this process, I discovered a few minor discrepancies between Android and iOS, such as different button styles and slight variations in screen layouts. I worked on fixing these issues by applying platform-specific styles and adjustments. By the end of the day, the app was performing well on both platforms, and I had addressed the major cross-platform concerns.
