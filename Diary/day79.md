### 2024-10-31: Task 79 - Creating a Maintenance Schedule

On Day 79, I focused on creating a maintenance schedule for the mobile app and website. Regular maintenance is essential for ensuring that both platforms remain secure, up-to-date, and bug-free. I coordinated with the development and operations teams to outline routine maintenance tasks, such as software updates, security patches, and performance optimizations. 

I also planned for more substantial maintenance windows, such as those needed for significant feature updates or infrastructure scaling. The schedule included predefined intervals for monitoring system performance, performing load tests, and addressing any critical issues that arise. By the end of the day, we had a comprehensive maintenance schedule in place, ensuring the long-term health and reliability of the platforms.
