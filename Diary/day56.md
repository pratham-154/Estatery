### 2024-09-27: Task 56 - Conducting User Acceptance Testing

On Day 56, I conducted User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure that the application met the needs and expectations of the end users. I collaborated with the stakeholders to define the acceptance criteria and created test scenarios based on real user interactions. During UAT, I tested various functionalities such as user registration, order placement, and payment processing.

The testing was conducted with real users who provided valuable feedback on the usability and functionality of the platform. I gathered their insights and made necessary improvements based on their feedback. By the end of the day, UAT was successfully completed, and the application was ready for final approval.
