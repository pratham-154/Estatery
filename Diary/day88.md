### 2024-11-14: Task 88 - Conducting Stakeholder Presentation

On Day 88, I conducted the stakeholder presentation, where I shared the progress and outcomes of the project with key stakeholders. The presentation highlighted the app’s and website's main features, user engagement metrics, and performance results. I focused on how the project met the initial goals and aligned with the company’s vision. 

The session was interactive, with stakeholders asking questions about specific aspects of the development process and future improvements. I emphasized the value the project has brought to the company, showcasing both quantitative and qualitative results. By the end of the presentation, I received positive feedback, confirming the success of the project and setting the stage for future enhancements.
