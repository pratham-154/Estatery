### 2024-08-19: Task 27 - Designing Responsive UI

On Day 27, I focused on designing a responsive user interface (UI) for the website, ensuring that it looked great on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors. I used CSS media queries to adapt the layout based on the width of the userâ€™s device, adjusting elements like the navigation bar, product grids, and images to fit the screen.

I also worked on improving the mobile user experience by optimizing touch interactions, such as making buttons larger and easier to tap, and ensuring that the text was readable without zooming. By the end of the day, the UI was fully responsive, providing a seamless and consistent experience across devices.
