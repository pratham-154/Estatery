### 2025-04-12: Task 64 - Connecting Property Listing Page with Backend

* Integrated the property listing page with the backend to dynamically fetch and display property listings.

* Implemented pagination and sorting features to make property browsing more efficient.

* Ensured that data, such as property name, price, and location, is fetched from the backend and rendered correctly on the frontend.

* Added filtering options (e.g., price range, type) to enable users to search and sort properties based on their preferences.
