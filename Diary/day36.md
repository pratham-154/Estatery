### 2024-08-30: Task 36 - Integrating Real-Time Notifications

On Day 36, I integrated real-time notifications into the application to enhance user engagement and communication. The notifications would alert users about important events, such as new product arrivals, order status updates, and promotional offers. I used a WebSocket connection to push notifications to the frontend in real time, ensuring that users received updates as soon as they occurred.

I also added a notification system that allowed users to view their alerts from a dropdown menu, where they could click to see more details. Each notification was designed to be actionable, providing users with options to view the related product or navigate to their order page. By the end of the day, the real-time notification system was fully integrated, improving user interaction with the platform.
