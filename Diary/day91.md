### 2024-11-19: Task 91 - Transitioning to Maintenance Mode

On Day 91, I worked on transitioning the app and website to maintenance mode. This involved ensuring that all essential features were stable and functioning properly, while also preparing for future updates and scaling efforts. I coordinated with the development and operations teams to make sure that the platforms could continue running smoothly while maintenance tasks were being performed.

I also set up monitoring tools to track the health of the app and website, ensuring that any issues could be quickly identified and addressed. By the end of the day, both the app and website were in maintenance mode, with a clear schedule for ongoing updates and performance monitoring.
