### 2024-08-22: Task 30 - Managing Global States with Redux

On Day 30, I continued working with Redux, focusing on managing the global state of the application more efficiently. I structured the store to handle different types of data, such as user authentication details, cart contents, and order information. By using Redux, I was able to ensure that this data could be accessed and updated from anywhere in the application, making the development process more organized and manageable.

I also implemented actions and reducers to allow various components to interact with the global state. For example, when a user logged in, their information was stored in the Redux state and could be easily accessed by any part of the application that needed it. Similarly, the shopping cart state was centralized, making it easy to add, remove, and update products from various pages. By the end of the day, the Redux setup was running smoothly, ensuring that state management was no longer fragmented across different parts of the app.
